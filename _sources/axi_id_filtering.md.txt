# AXI Transaction ID Filtering

In order to facilitate constraining the recovery core's accessibility, the I3C core implements an AXI transaction ID filtering mechanism.

Transaction IDs are passed using the `aruser` and `awuser` signals.

The ID filtering logic is optional and depends on the `AXI_ID_FILTERING` macro definition.

Recovery core configuration includes a parameter denoting the `NUM_PRIV_IDS` - number of privileged IDs that are granted read and write access when the filtering mechanism is enabled.

Having `AXI_ID_FILTERING` defined requires `NUM_PRIV_IDS` to be greater than 0. This is verified with an assertion.

Undefined `AXI_ID_FILTERING` and non-zero `NUM_PRIV_IDS` are considered a legal configuration and causes the ID filtering logic **to not be included** in the design.

The filtering mechanism is controlled via:

* `disable_axi_filtering_i` recovery core port to disable the filtering mechanism
   * `1'b0` - enable AXI filtering
   * `1'b1` - disable AXI filtering
* `[0:AXI_ID_WIDTH-1] priv_ids_i [0:NUM_PRIV_IDS-1]` recovery core port containing privileged IDs
   * Each privileged ID should be of width `AXI_ID_WIDTH` passed at `priv_ids_i[k]` for each **k** in **{0 â€¦ NUM_PRIV_IDS - 1}**
   * All `NUM_PRIV_IDS` entries are expected to be set to valid privileged IDs

When the filtering is enabled, any transaction attempt outside of the privileged IDs will be met with a `SLVERR` (`0b10`) error on the respective AXI response channel.

The above-mentioned `disable_axi_filtering_i` and `priv_ids_i` ports will not be included in the design if `AXI_ID_FILTERING` is not defined.
