        Spawns a TTI agent that reads from TTI descriptor and data queues
        and stores received data.

        While the agent is running the test issues several private writes
        over I3C. Data sent over I3C is compared with data received by
        the agent.

        The test runs at core clock of 100 and 200 MHz. The slowest clock that does not result in a tSCO violation is 166 MHz.
        The I3C bus clock is set to 12.5 MHz.
